# NOTES

## HTML

- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes provide additional information about elements
- Attributes are always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
- The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen
